# RESTAURANT RECOMMENDATION USING CONTENT-BASED FILTERING

Using combination of __Random Forest Classifier & Cosine Similarity__ to predict the top 5 restaurant in Mexico which suitable with user preferences depende on 7 criterias:
1. __City__
2. __Alcohol__
3. __Smoking Area__
4. __Dress Code__
5. __Price__
6. __Ambience__
7. __Area__

I use datasets from __["Restaurant Data with Consumer Ratings"](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/restaurant-data-with-consumer-ratings#userprofile.csv)__ provided by Kaggle.

You could clone this Github and try to run __*app_resto_recom.py*__

In brief there are 3 html pages which will show you this restaurant recommendation system:

1. Home Page

    At the home page you are supposed to give 7 input criterias what kind of restaurant that you're looking for:

    ![Restaurant](images/home.png)

    Then, the machine will give you top 5 restaurant recommendations that 80% up fits with you.

2. Result Page

    In this page will summarize what are your inputs and the results of top 5 restaurant recommendations

    ![Result](images/result.png)

    Then you can find the restaurant locations on maps, or just go back to home page

3. Map Page

    In this page will give you the coordinate of Top 5 restaurant recommendations on maps. I use [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) packages to show this map

Hope you enjoy it.. Cheers!
